# AXIOM-Beta softwares

This repo include the libraries, services, sample programs used in the AXIOM beta camera.

# Suggestions to Apertus on re-organizing the repos/folders
1. __configs__ directory is unneeded because it's either all copied to in __/etc__ when building the build system or contained in the package that uses it.
2. __http__ is moved to a separate repo and built as a package. (for various reasons)
